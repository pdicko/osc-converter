# OSC Converter

A serial-to-tcp bridge written in python. ETC Eos lighting consoles allow OSC messages to be sent over USB serial or a TCP connection. This script will be loaded onto a small Raspberry Pi Zero 2. A USB device can be connected to it, essentially converting it into an ethernet device. This way, the device is not limited to the length of a USB cable. It can be used anywhere there is ethernet access to the lighting rig.
